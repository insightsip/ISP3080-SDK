UWB examples using ISP3080-UX

## Overview

The aim of this archive is to show examples of UWB applications using the ISP3080-UX module.

The ISP3080-UX module is based on Qorvo / DecaWave QM33110 single-chip UWB transceiver and nRF52833 Nordic Semiconductor 2.4GHz wireless System on Chip (SoC). It integrates a 32-bit ARM Cortexâ„¢ M4 CPU, 512 kB flash memory, 128 kB RAM as well as analog and digital peripherals. Despite the small size of 12 x 12 x 1.5 mm, the module integrates decoupling capacitors, 38.4 MHz crystal for UWB, 32 MHz and 32.768kHz crystals for BLE, DC-DC converters, RF matching circuits and two antennas in addition to the wireless SoCs. Low power consumption and advanced power management enables battery lifetimes up to several months on a coin cell battery.

## Environment

The examples are ready to use with the Segger Embedded Studio (SES) IDE. Using SES version 5.42a is recommended.

SES provide a free license for nRF52833 development. Therefore it can be used freely for ISP4520 development.
